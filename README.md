# PenguinAnalysis
This project aims to predict the species of penguins using the Palmer's Penguins dataset. The dataset includes various features such as bill length, bill depth, flipper length, body mass, island location, and sex which are used to classify three different penguin species: Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo. This project motivation was driven by my peers obsession with different penguin species and lots of cute penguin videos. :)

## Overview
Within the project, I performed key data analysis to build a machine learning model to predict penguin species with high accuracy. The key objectives are as follow:

* **Data Exploration**: Throughly exploring the dataset to find interesting patterns and relationships.
* **Data Preprocessing**: Handled missing values and prepared data for machine learning models.
* **Model Implementation**: Built and trained Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers to predict penguin species.
* **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated models performance based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, and selected the best performing model.

## Results
Through this project, I was able to use different machine learning models to predict and classify different penguin species with varying degrees of accuracy. With this said, the Random Forest model showed the best performance with 99% accuracy.
